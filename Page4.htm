  <b class="w3-justify">Finally, Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would allow him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And so it was that Death reluctantly handed over his own cloak of invisibility. Death searched for many years but was never able to find him. Only when he attained a great age did the youngest brother shed the Cloak of Invisibility and give it to his sonâ€¦He then he greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals. <br>
